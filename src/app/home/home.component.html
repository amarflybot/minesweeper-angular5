  <h1>Welcome To MineSweeper!!</h1>
  <p class="lead">Overview</p>
  <p>
    The player is initially presented with a grid of undifferentiated squares. Some randomly selected squares, unknown
    to the player, are designated to contain mines. Typically, the size of the grid and the number of mines are set in
    advance by the user, either by entering the numbers or selecting from defined skill levels, depending on the
    implementations. (In the Microsoft variant, this is limited to 30 times 24 with 667 mines.)

    The game is played by revealing squares of the grid by clicking or otherwise indicating each square. If a square
    containing a mine is revealed, the player loses the game. If no mine is revealed, a digit is instead displayed in
    the square, indicating how many adjacent squares contain mines; if no mines are adjacent, the square becomes blank,
    and all adjacent squares will be recursively revealed. The player uses this information to deduce the contents of
    other squares, and may either safely reveal each square or mark the square as containing a mine.

    In some versions, a question mark may be placed in an unrevealed square to serve as an aid to logical deduction.
    Implementations may also allow players to quickly "clear around" a revealed square once the correct number of mines
    have been flagged around it. The game is won when all mine-free squares are revealed, because all mines have been
    located.

    Some versions of Minesweeper will set up the board by never placing a mine on the first square revealed.[1]
    Minesweeper for versions of Windows protects the first square revealed; in Windows 7, players may elect to replay a
    board, in which case the first square may no longer be protected.

  <p class="lead">History</p>
  <p>
    Minesweeper has its origins in the earliest mainframe games of the 1960s and 1970s. The earliest ancestor of
    Minesweeper was Jerimac Ratliff's Cube. The basic gameplay style became a popular segment of the puzzle game genre
    during the 1980s, with such titles as Mined-Out (Quicksilva, 1983), Yomp (Virgin Interactive, 1983), and Cube. Cube
    was succeeded by Relentless Logic (or RLogic for short), by Conway, Hong, and Smith, available for MS-DOS as early
    as 1985; the player took the role of a private in the United States Marine Corps, delivering an important message to
    the U.S. Command Center. RLogic had greater similarity to Minesweeper than to Cube in concept, but a number of
    differences exist:

    In RLogic, the player must navigate through the minefield, from the top left right angled corner to the bottom right
    right angled corner (the Command Center).
    It is not necessary to clear all non-mine squares. Also, there is no mechanism for marking mines or counting the
    number of mines found.
    The number of steps taken is counted. Although no high score functionality is included, players could attempt to
    beat their personal best score for a given number of mines.
    Unlike Minesweeper, the size of the minefield is fixed. However, the player may still specify the number of mines.
    Because the player must navigate through the minefield, it is sometimes impossible to win â€” namely, when the mines
    block all possible paths.
    The gameplay mechanics of Minesweeper are included in a variety of other software titles, including:

    The mini-game Vinesweeper implemented into the MMORPG RuneScape; in this iteration (written by Jagex developer Danny
    J), the Minesweeper gameplay is given a large multiplayer aspect and the "game board" adopts a continually resetting
    timer. This allows for a never-ending game of Minesweeper where the skill is assessed in points rather than "game
    completion".
    The PC game Mole Control (developed by Remode); in this game, the minesweeper mechanic is integrated into a puzzle
    adventure game based in a village called Molar Creek, which has been overrun with exploding moles. You play the
    local inventor's assistant, who is tasked with clearing the village of exploding moles, and you can also take part
    in the Molar Creek Annual Mole Control competition in a Time Attack Mode.

    In 2000, Richard Kaye published a proof that it is NP-complete to determine whether a given grid of uncovered,
    correctly flagged, and unknown squares, the labels of the foremost also given, has an arrangement of mines for which
    it is possible within the rules of the game. The argument is constructive, a method to quickly convert any Boolean
    circuit into such a grid that is possible if and only if the circuit is satisfiable; membership in NP is established
    by using the arrangement of mines as a certificate.[3] If, however, a minesweeper board is already guaranteed to be
    consistent, solving it is not known to be NP-complete, but interestingly it has been proven to be co-NP-complete.[4]

    Kaye also proved that infinite minesweeper is Turing complete.[5]
